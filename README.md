# fstar-docker-workspace
F* Docker Workspace easy install

This repository contains two scripts to easily install F* without having to go through a painful native installation.
To use the scripts, first install Docker, then run ./install.sh and then ./run.sh.
Write your programs in a .fst file and save them in the workspace/ directory to execute them.
To execute a program from the workspace, simply run fstar.exe <filename>.fst (replace <filename> with the actual name of the file, of course).
